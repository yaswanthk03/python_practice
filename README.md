# 🐍 Python Practice & Learning Repository

This repository contains all the Python concepts, experiments, and hands-on mini-projects I worked on while learning Python.  
It includes **async programming, automation, data handling, data science, Pydantic, multiprocessing, web scraping**, and more.

The purpose of this repo is to document my learning journey and maintain a practical reference for real-world Python applications.
